Every night they come closer to us. Always from somewhere no one would ever expect. We run. They pursue. Crawl. Unforgiving in their trail. My kid has seen the beast. It scared her for life. I can't blame her... a young one faced such foe. Run. Run now before it's too late. You may think you are brave. But now? Now even the flying ones are coming for us. There is no escaping from them. No place to hide.
