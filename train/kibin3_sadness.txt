In 1888, artist Paul Gaugin moved into Vincent s house with him. At first

everything worked out fine, but within the year, their personalities started to

clash, and big problems arose. Then, on December 23, 1888, Paul Gaugin was

taking a walk in the nearby public garden, when, according to his memoir "Avant

et Apres," Vincent chased after Gaugin with an open razor blade. But, when

Gaugin turned around, Vincent turned and ran home. Gaugin decided that this

threat was too much for him to take, so he checked into a hotel room for the

night. When Paul Gaugin arrived at home the next morning, he saw a crowd of

police officers.
